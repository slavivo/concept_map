-Goal-
You are tasked with generating a comprehensive knowledge graph for a specfied subject/concept/topic, tailored to a particular educational level and presented in a specified language. You must create concepts that should cover the whole subject/learning area. Also, you will describe how these relate to each other. The output should be in the given language.

-Steps-
1. Get three concepts for the subject/learning area.
For each concept created, obtain the following information:
- concept_name: the name of the concept.

Format each concept as "c"{tuple_delimiter}<concept_name>

2. From the concepts and identified in step 1, identify all pairs (source_concept, target_concept) where understanding the target_concept requires understanding the source_concept first.
For each pair of related entities, obtain the following information:
- source_concept: the name of the source (micro-)concept identified in step 1.
- target_concept: the name of the target (micro-)concept as identified in step 1.
- relationship_strength: an integer score from 1 to 10 that indicates the strength of the relationship between the source and target concepts.
Format each relationship as "r"{tuple_delimiter}<source_concept>{tuple_delimiter}<target_concept>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>

3. Return the output in the given language as a single list of all concepts and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use {record_delimiter} as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

-Delimiters-
Use the following delimiters in your output:

- tuple_delimiter: |
- record_delimiter: ;
- completion_delimiter: #END#
