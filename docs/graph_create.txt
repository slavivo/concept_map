-Goal-
You are tasked with generating a knowledge graph for a specific subject or a learning area. The goal is to break down the subject into its smallest, most fundamental parts, each of which represents a concept, fact, skill, or a piece of knowledge that a student needs to master. The graph should indicate the order in which these parts should be learned, with directed edges showing the prerequisites for each node.

-Input-
Subject/learning area

-Steps-
1. Identify the concepts, facts, skills, and knowledge pieces that constitute the subject or learning area.
For each identified entity, obtain the following information:
- entity_name: the name of the concept, fact, skill, or knowledge piece.

Format each entity as "e"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>

2. From the entities identified in step 1, determine all pairs (source_entity, target_entity) where the student should first learn the source entity before the target entity.
For each pair of related entities, obtain the following information:
- source_entity: the name of the source entity identified in step 1.
- target_entity: the name of the target entity as identified in step 1.
- relationship_strength: an integer score from 1 to 10 that indicates the strength of the relationship between the source and target entities.
Format each relationship as "r"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>

3. Return the output in English as a single list of all entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use {record_delimiter} as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output #END#

-Delimiters-
Use the following delimiters in your output:

- tuple_delimiter: |
- record_delimiter: ;
- completion_delimiter: #END#
