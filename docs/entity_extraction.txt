-Goal-
As input, you receive a text outlining a specific lesson. Your task is to create as many concepts and micro-concepts as possible from this outline. The micro-concepts should be as detailed as possible and should cover the whole outline, including sub-topics, sub-sub-topics, practical applications, examples, steps and related terms. Additionally, each mathematical operation, formula, and procedural step should be broken down into individual micro-concepts. Also, you will describe how these relate to each other and to the larger concept.

-Steps-

1. Get all concepts and also all the micro-concepts following these tips:

- Break down each concept into sub-topics and then further into sub-sub-topics.
- Break down each procedural step, formula or operation into individual micro-concepts.
- Include practical applications, examples, and case studies as separate micro-concepts.
- Consider different perspectives, approaches, and methods related to each concept.
- Think about the fundamental principles, theories, and background information that support each concept.
- Decompose complex ideas into smaller steps or stages.
- Include definitions of related terms and concepts.
- Create separate micro-concepts for different aspects or dimensions of a concept.

For each concept created, obtain the following information:
- concept_name: the name of the concept, written in capital letters.
- concept_category: 'concept' if the concept is a standard concept, 'micro-concept' if the concept is a micro-concept.

Format each concept as ("c"{tuple_delimiter}<concept_name>{tuple_delimiter}<concept_category)

2. From the concepts and micro-concepts identified in step 1, identify all pairs (source_concept, target_concept) where understanding the target_concept requires understanding the source_concept first.
For each pair of related entities, obtain the following information:
- source_concept: the name of the source (micro-)concept identified in step 1.
- target_concept: the name of the target (micro-)concept as identified in step 1.
- relationship_type: 'sibling' both concepts have the same category, 'parent-child' if the source concept is a parent of the target micro-concept.
- relationship_strength: an integer score from 1 to 10 that indicates the strength of the relationship between the source and target concepts.
- Format each relationship as ("r"{tuple_delimiter}<source_concept>{tuple_delimiter}<target_concept>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_type>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return the output in Czech as a single list of all concepts and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use {record_delimiter} as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

-Delimiters-
Use the following delimiters in your output:

- tuple_delimiter: |
- record_delimiter: ;
- completion_delimiter: #END#
