-Goal-
As input, you will receive a learning concept. Your task is to create micro-concepts related to this concept. The micro-concepts should be about the concept sub-topics, sub-sub-topics, steps and related terms. Additionally, each mathematical operation, formula, and procedural step should be broken down into individual micro-concepts. Also, you will describe how these micro-concepts relate to each other.

-Steps-

1. Get all the micro-concepts infered from the concept (don't include the learning concept you received).
For each created micro-concepts, obtain the following information:
- concept_name: the name of the concept.

Format each micro-concept as "c"{tuple_delimiter}<concept_name>

2. From the micro-concepts identified in step 1, identify all pairs (source_concept, target_concept) where understanding the target_concept requires understanding the source_concept first.
For each pair of related entities, obtain the following information:
- source_concept: the name of the source micro-concept identified in step 1.
- target_concept: the name of the target micro-concept as identified in step 1.
- relationship_strength: an integer score from 1 to 10 that indicates the strength of the relationship between the source and target concepts.
Format each relationship as "r"{tuple_delimiter}<source_concept>{tuple_delimiter}<target_concept>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>

3. Return the output in English as a single list of all concepts and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use {record_delimiter} as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

-Delimiters-
Use the following delimiters in your output:

- tuple_delimiter: |
- record_delimiter: ;
- completion_delimiter: #END#
