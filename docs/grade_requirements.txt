-Goal-
Your goal is to determine the appropriate grade level for each concept from a given list based on a separate JSON object specifying mandatory curriculum content by grade. A concept should be assigned to a grade not only if it directly matches a learning outcome, but also if it is just a prerequisite for learning an outcome. If a concept does not relate to any curriculum outcomes, classify it as "o" (optional).

-Input-
Language: Specify the language of both the input and the output.
Concepts about <subject>: A list of labels representing various concepts along with the information about the overarching subejct.
Curriculum outputs: A JSON object each key is, and the corresponding value is a list of content items that should be learned at that grade.

-Steps-
1. For each concept in the Concepts list, determine the appropriate grade level using the Curriculum Outputs. 
2. Consider both direct matches and prerequisites for determining grade levels.
3. If the concept is not found in the curriculum JSON, classify it as "-1".

-Output-
Format the output for each concept as follows without any additional text:
<concept_label>: <recommended_grade>\n
